        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
 My name is <strong>Oyinkansola Jegede</strong>, but most people know me as <strong>Sparkle</strong>. 
 <br> <br>
I’ve always been drawn to stories, the kind that sit quietly with you, the kind that make you feel seen, the kind that remind you that your voice matters. Somewhere along the way, that curiosity turned into a life built around <strong>voice, media, and meaningful conversation</strong>.
<br> <br>
My journey into broadcasting and journalism began with training at the <strong>National Broadcast Academy</strong>, and over time, I found my way through radio, television, and content production, learning not just how to speak, but how to listen. From early training at <strong>TVC Communications</strong>, to writing at <strong>Max FM 102.3</strong>, and hosting and production roles at <strong>City FM 105.1 and Crowther 88.5FM</strong>, I’ve worn many hats: presenter, writer, voice-over artist, and storyteller. Each role taught me the same lesson, clarity connects, and intention gives words their power.
<br> <br>
I also host the <strong>“What’s Trending” podcast</strong>, where I explore pop culture, social conversations, and the everyday stories that shape how we think and feel. It’s a space where curiosity leads, and honesty is never optional.
<br> <br>
Being a <strong>law graduate</strong> has shaped how I approach communication, with structure, confidence, and purpose, while my experience in project management helps me bring ideas to life in a way that is both creative and grounded.
<br> <br>
Whether I’m behind a microphone, on a stage, or in a room full of people, my goal remains the same: to create moments that resonate, conversations that linger, and stories that feel real.
<br><br>
This space is a reflection of that journey, still unfolding, still evolving. <br>
You’re welcome to explore, listen, and connect.
