If someone had told me that a day would come where I would be trending on Instablog for fighting a yellow bus conductor on third mainland bridge, I would have called them insane but unfortunately, my phone was still ringing, I’m sure my mum must have called 50 times by now, only God knows how she heard, I thought she doesn’t even use Instagram, oh wait, Jesus that means my matter has even reached Facebook, I could feel the messages pouring in from all over and all I could think about was Akin and what he would think when he sees it.

I stood up and walked to the mirror in my apartment, I no longer recognized myself, this wasn’t the plan, I followed all the YouTube tutorials diligently, some said use turmeric and honey, I did just that, some even said take a bath with oats and milk, I did that too, every morning and night I applied all the products that I spent most of my salary on but still, nothing changed...`

It’s so weird how the smallest thing can happen and it would set you back ten paces, I mean you’ve stayed up all night building blocks of confidence, watching self-esteem videos, curating the perfect playlist for days when you get down and then all of a sudden the tiniest comment from somebody who you shouldn’t even take serious comes along and then it’s like all of that work come crashing down.

So now, you begin an internal dilemma “Was I ever who I thought I was?”, “Who exactly am I?” “Who have I been?” And you begin to try to decipher whether what the world sees has just been a façade...`
